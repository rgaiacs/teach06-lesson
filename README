This is my final project for the 6th class of Software Carpentry Instructors.

Here you will find all the files that I used for my "Git: solving conflicts"
lesson.

Greg Wilson has a nice video (licensed under CC-BY) about solving conflicts for
svn at http://software-carpentry.org/v4/vc/conflict.html. I like so much the
story of Wolfman and Dracula that I will use it.

## Public

I planned this lesson for someone that have at least 10 hours of practice with
git (let say working two hours for five days in some project that use git for
version control).

## Summary

Wolfman and Dracula are working in a repository from Mummy that pretty print one
CSV file in the terminal.

Mummy use ONLY Python2, Dracula use ONLY Python3 and Wolfman use both (during
the lesson Dracula convinced Wolfman to use Python3).

## Setup

Run

    $ ./setup

It will two new directories: `dracula` and `wolfman` that are the working
directory of Dracula and Wolfman, respectively.

Open two terminals. In the first one go to `dracula` and type

    $ source bashrc

And in the second one go to `wolfman` and type the same command.
